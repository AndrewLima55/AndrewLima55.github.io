    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: a">When I was younger, my favorite pastime was putting together small electric circuits from a kit to power fans and lights. I may have enjoyed
     electronics because both my mother's and my father's side of the family include many engineers. After taking an online coding camp, I realized that I enjoy coding 
     very much, so much that I would like to work in this field. My plan for achieving this goal is to take all the computer science classes available at Palm Desert High
     School. Then, I will take computer science classes at community college in Palm Desert. Taking all local classes available will prepare me for majoring in computer 
     science.</p>

    <p>When I really enjoy what I am doing, I have laser focus. In middle school, I loved playing the trumpet. I spent a lot of time playing the trumpet
    at home, at school, and after school with my friends. I was able to make it into the California All State Honor Band throughout middle school. Then,
    my friends and I won first place at the Palm Desert Middle School talent show. Recently, I have turned my focus to coding. Trumpet is a fun hobby,
    but coding is the career I want.</p>

    <p>I am fascinated by Tech Titans and CEOs. In 3rd grade, I chose to give a presentation on the life of Steve Jobs. Other people chose sports figures,
    historical figures, and celebrities. But for me, the people who are changing the world and creating the future are Elon Musk of Tesla and Space X and Jeff
    Bezos of Amazon. I want to work for a tech company which is creating the future of the world. I want to work for one of the legendary figures that I have
    admired for so long. </p>

    <p>In conclusion, I am very grateful for the opportunity to take computer science at Palm Desert High School. It is the start of my path to an awesome career.
    Thank you for visiting my site. Please take a moment to look around and feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
