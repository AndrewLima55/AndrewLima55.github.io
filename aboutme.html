    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>When I was younger, my favorite pastime was putting together small electric circuits from a kit to power fans and lights. I have may enjoyed
     electronics because both my mother's and my father's side of the family include many engineers. After taking an online coding camp, I realized
     that I enjoy coding very much, so much that I would like to work in this field. My plans for achieving this goal is to learn a lot from this class.
     I plan to take computer science both junior and senior year as well. I want be well prepared for majoring in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>When I really enjoy what I'm doing, I have laser focus. In middle school, I loved music and trumpet a lot.  I spent a lot of time playing trumpet
    at home, at school, and after school with my friends. I was able to make it into the California All State Honor Band throughout middle school. Then,
    my friends and I won first place at the Palm Desert Middle School talent show. Recently, I have turned my focus on coding. Trumpet is a fun hobby,
    but coding is the career I want.</p>

    <p>I am fascinated by Tech Titans and CEOs. In 3rd grade, I chose to give a presentation on the life of Steve Jobs. Other people chose sports figures,
    historical figures, and celebrities. But for me, the people who are changing the world and creating the future are Elon Musk of Tesla and Space X and Jeff
    Bezos of Amazon. I want to work for a tech company which is creating the future of the world. I want to work for one of these legendary figures that I have
    admired for so long. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In conclusion, I am very grateful for the opportunity to take Computer Science at Palm Desert High School. I plan to make the most of the knowledge
    that I am gaining here. I hope it is the start of path to an awesome career. Thank you for visiting my site and checking it out.</p>
